# celestialmagnitudecalculator
This C# program, the Apparent Magnitude Calculator, allows users to calculate the apparent magnitude of celestial objects based on their distance and intrinsic brightness. 
Apparent magnitude is a measure of the brightness of an object as observed from Earth. The program uses a formula that takes into account the object's intrinsic brightness and distance to provide an accurate apparent magnitude.

## Features

**User-Friendly Interface:**

The program prompts users for input, making it accessible for those interested in celestial objects.

**Accurate Calculation:**

Utilizes the formula for apparent magnitude to provide precise results.

**Tested and Verified:**

The code includes unit tests using Microsoft's MSTest framework to ensure the correctness of the apparent magnitude calculation.

## How to Use

**Clone the repository to your local machine:**
```
git clone https://github.com/krisztipely/celestialmagnitudecalculator.git
```
Open the project in Microsoft Visual Studio or your preferred C# development environment.

Run the ApparentMagnitudeCalculator class to interactively calculate apparent magnitude.

Explore and modify the code to integrate it into your projects or applications.

## Example

```
Apparent Magnitude Calculator for Celestial Objects
-----------------------------------------------
Enter the distance to the celestial object (in parsecs): 10
Enter the intrinsic brightness of the celestial object (in watts): 5
Apparent Magnitude: 8.69
```

## Unit Testing
The code includes a set of unit tests in the ApparentMagnitudeCalculatorTests class to ensure the accuracy of the apparent magnitude calculation. These tests can be run using a testing framework like MSTest.
